- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Jinwoo Park and I'm a mathematics graduate with deep interests in functional analysis, causal inference, and the mathematical foundations of machine learning. I created this GitHub space to document my learning journey, share applied projects, and explore how rigorous mathematical tools can lead to more interpretable and reliable ML models.
Currently, Iâ€™m preparing for a masterâ€™s in statistics at McGill University, where I plan to focus my thesis on areas like operator learning, Bayesian methods, and causal machine learning â€” all fields that lie at the intersection of theory and real-world impact. This page reflects my ongoing effort to build a strong technical portfolio using tools like JAX, PyTorch, GPyTorch, Stan, EconML, and etc.
